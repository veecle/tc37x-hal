## Demo HAL for AURIXâ„¢ tc37x lite-kit

Demo implementation of a HAL for the [TC375-Lite kit]. The HAL is very limited at the moment and only supports
- Clock configuration via `pll` and `ccu` wrappers: configurations are hard-coded for the TC375
- Basic handling of time and delay
- CAN-driver: this is more or less working in a simplified (and untested) manner 

For usage and documentation refer to the [veecle-aurix-demo] crate.

**This is a basic and likely wrong implementation: this only serves as proof of concept and nothing more; future MRs will transform this to a more correctly designed and validated HAL**
