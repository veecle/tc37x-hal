## Demo HAL for AURIXâ„¢ tc37x lite-kit

Demo implementation of an HAL for the [TC375-Lite kit]. The HAL is very limited at the moment and only supports
- Clock configuration via `pll` and `ccu` wrappers: configurations are hardcoded for the TC375
- Basic handling of time and delay
- CAN-driver: this is more or less working in simplified manner 

For full usage documentation refer to the [veecle-aurix-demo] crate.
